        Interpreted
        Extension: .py, compiled: .pyc
        case sensitive
        dynamic typed language
        python uses indentation to seperate statements
        in python everything is an object.

        How to write code in python
        Smallest unit/element of the program.
            Keyword
                Reserved words.
                33
                Rule: all keyword should be written into
                lower case letter, except: True False None
            Variable
                is a container to store values/data temporary
                whose value can be change.
                
            constant
                is a variable whose value cannot be changed.
                constant is a myth in python.
                convention: a variable name with uppercase,
                assume as constant
                
            literals
                values assinged into variable and constant
            separator
                
            identifiers
                are words which distinguise/describe values,
                block of code, process
                e.g.: variable, constant, function name, class
                name, method name

                Rules to declare to identifiers:
                    1. No keywords
                    2. Not starts with digit, digit can be
                    inbetween
                    3. no space in single name
                    4. No special character, except _
                    convention: a class name should be in
                    pascalcase
                    
            operators
                are symbols/words used to perform operation
                on values.
